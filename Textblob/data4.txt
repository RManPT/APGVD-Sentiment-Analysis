Hello Love,
If you ask me to put it into words the feeling of appreciation in my heart that you’re mine now, I wouldn’t be able to, because I found no word to qualifies it.
Fate brought you to me and as our lives entwined was just by fate too.
Having found you and loving you makes my life worth living, since I now live for you, my love. You’re my best amongst the rest; you’re my inspiration; you’re my prime joy and my best friend forever.
And I will always love you better than I did yesterday and today.
I love you dearly.
